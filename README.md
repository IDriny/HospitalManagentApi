### I'm glad to share that I finished working on my first web app using ASP.NET Core 
- It's simple an API for a hospital management system
- Here is tha like for swagger documentation
    - https://hospitalmanagentapi20250601133735-f4fwc9f7duanb5b3.israelcentral-01.azurewebsites.net
- and here the web app that used my API
   - https://hospital-project-ruddy.vercel.app/
- THat is my first project and I'm sure it's not the last, so stay tuned from more projects
- this project have been developed in cooperation with my dear friend and cooworker:  [Mohammed Tark](https://github.com/sezeef)
